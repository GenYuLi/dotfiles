## Installation
**Warning:** These are my configuration for zsh, tmux, and vim. Before you fork this repository, be sure to review the code in advance. Don't blindly use my setting unless you know what that entails. ___Use at your own risk!___

### oh-my-zsh
If you haven't install oh-my-zsh yet, follow the instruction
[here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

Install it with either `curl` or `wget`.

**via curl**
```
# sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

**via wget**
```
# sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

### Using git
You can clone the repository anywhere you want, but do it before you backup your previous settings (eg: .vimrc, .zshrc...), the process will overwrite those files.

```
# git clone "http://github.com/williamhsieh/.dotfile" && ./.dotfile/init
```
