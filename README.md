## Installation
**Warning:** Before you fork this repository, be sure to review the code in advance. Don't blindly use my setting unless you know what that entails. ***Use at your own risk!***

* If you don't have ```oh-my-zsh``` installed, follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
* ```xclip``` the tool I used to copy content from vim buffer to clipboard. Install if needed.

### Using Git and the init script
Make sure to backup your previous settings (```.vimrc```, ```.zshrc```, ```.tmux.conf```), the ```init``` process will overwrite those files.

```
$ cd && git clone "http://github.com/williamhsieh/.dotfile" && ./.dotfile/init
```
