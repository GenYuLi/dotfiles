## Installation
**Warning:** These are my configuration for zsh, tmux, and vim. Before you fork this repository, be sure to review the code in advance. Don't blindly use my setting unless you know what that entails. __Use at your own risk!__

### Using git
You can clone the repository anywhere you want, but do it before you backup your previous settings (eg: .vimrc, .zshrc...), the process will overwrite those files.

```
$ git clone "http://github.com/williamhsieh/.dotfile" && ./.dotfile/init
```
